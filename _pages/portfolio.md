Even though speaking is learned readily at a relatively early stage of development, it is far from a simple process. Rather, in order to speak even a single word, we must map the semantic concept we want to convey to a specific word, which must then be broken down into the minute phonological units found within our specific language system. My research investigates how people navigate this intricate process.

    <h2>Semantic Interference</h2>
    <p>You may recall instances in which your parent mistakenly referred to you by your sibling’s name, or perhaps worse, by the cat’s name. While it may be tempting to attribute this error to a lack of parental affection, it is in reality a reflection of the interconnectivity among related concepts and words. It is thought that the activation of one concept leads to the concurrent activation of semantically related concepts, as well as the respective words associated with those concepts (e.g., Dell et al., 1997; Levelt et al., 1999). This results in the activation of multiple words when only one can be spoken at any given time. Lexical selection, or the mapping of a concept to a single word, is a critical stage in production that is well poised to illuminate the interface between our memory and language systems. The phenomenon I have used to study this interface is termed the <em>semantic interference effect</em>, the phenomenon in which it is more difficult to produce a word amidst semantically related words.</p>

### How do we study it?
