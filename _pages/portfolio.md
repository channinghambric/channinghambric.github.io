Even though speaking is learned readily at a relatively early stage of development, it is far from a simple process. Rather, in order to speak even a single word, we must map the semantic concept we want to convey to a specific word, which must then be broken down into the minute phonological units found within our specific language system. My research investigates how people navigate this intricate process.

    <h2 style="color: #6666CC;">Semantic Interference</h2>
    <p>
      You may recall instances in which your parent mistakenly referred to you by your sibling’s name, or perhaps worse, by the cat’s name. While it may be tempting to attribute this error to a lack of parental affection, it is in reality a reflection of the interconnectivity among related concepts and words. Activation of one concept leads to the concurrent activation of semantically related concepts, as well as the respective words associated with those concepts (e.g., Dell et al., 1997; Levelt et al., 1999). Lexical selection, or the mapping of a concept to a single word, is a critical stage in production that is well poised to illuminate the interface between our memory and language systems. Notably, the activation of multiple words when only one can be spoken at any given time can result in production difficulty, or <em>semantic interference</em>.

<h3 style="color: #6666CC;">How do we study it?</h3> 
Semantic interference is often studied through timed picture naming tasks that require generation of names from memory. Pictures are assumed to activate conceptual knowledge and corresponding sectors of the lexicon from which the most fitting name is selected. Picture naming is thus a proxy for the general process of conceptually-driven word retrieval. We typically measure how long it takes a participant to produce the name of the picture as well as any errors they may make. Researchers have used the picture-interference task, the cyclic (blocked) picture naming task, and the continuous picture naming task to study this phenomenon. The general finding is that it takes longer to name a picture if you have recently named a related picture, and production difficulty increases linearly with the number of named associates.

<h3 style="color: #6666CC;">Bridging Language and Memory Approaches to Interference</h3> 

The semantic interference effect in language production is markedly similar to the memory phenomenon of <em>retrieval-induced forgetting</em>. Although retrieval-induced forgetting paradigms use cued word-stem procedures instead of picture naming, they find the same basic effed: recalling an item from memory makes it more difficult to recall semantically related items later on (Anderson et al., 1994). Researchers have posited that semantic interference in language production is essentially a form of retrieval-induced forgetting, such that the same central mechanism could be responsible for both effects (Oppenheim et al., 2010; Navarrete et al., 2021). In light of these considerations, we designed an experiment that brings the memory and language production literatures into dialogue. We measured latencies across ordinal positions of related items in the "retrieval practice" phase of a retrieval-induced forgetting paradigm and implemented a continuous picture naming task in the final phase. In the retrieval practice phase, we found that interference accrues linearly in the retrieval practice phase, directly mimicking the findings in the language production literature. In addition, we found that generating words in response to word-stem cues made it more difficult to name pictures related to those words ("Activated" condition) compared to controls. Together, these findings suggest that language and memory literatures may be studying different aspects of the same underlying incrmemental learning mechanism.
