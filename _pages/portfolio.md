Even though speaking is learned readily at a relatively early stage of development, it is far from a simple process. Rather, in order to speak even a single word, we must map the semantic concept we want to convey to a specific word, which must then be broken down into the minute phonological units found within our specific language system. My research investigates how people navigate this intricate process.

    <h2 style="color: #6666CC;">Semantic Interference</h2>
    <p>
      You may recall instances in which your parent mistakenly referred to you by your sibling’s name, or perhaps worse, by the cat’s name. While it may be tempting to attribute this error to a lack of parental affection, it is in reality a reflection of the interconnectivity among related concepts and words. Activation of one concept leads to the concurrent activation of semantically related concepts, as well as the respective words associated with those concepts (e.g., Dell et al., 1997; Levelt et al., 1999). Lexical selection, or the mapping of a concept to a single word, is a critical stage in production that is well poised to illuminate the interface between our memory and language systems. Notably, the activation of multiple words when only one can be spoken at any given time can result in production difficulty, or <em>semantic interference</em>. This line of work was carried out in conjunction with my graduate advisor at Lehigh University, *[Dr. Pat O'Seaghdha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bs-d3CUAAAAJ&hl=en)*.

<h3 style="color: #6666CC;">How do we study it?</h3> 
Semantic interference is often studied through timed picture naming tasks that require generation of names from memory. We typically measure how long it takes a participant to produce the name of the picture as well as the type of errors they make. Researchers have used the picture-interference task, the cyclic (blocked) picture naming task, and the continuous picture naming task to study this phenomenon. The general finding is that it takes longer to name a picture if you have recently named a related picture, and production difficulty increases linearly with the number of named associates.  This phenomenom highlights how context and experience directly shape our access to words. Check out *[this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17470218221144460)* about a study we did comparing different naming paradigms, and what they can tell us about production.

<h3 style="color: #6666CC;">Bridging Language and Memory Approaches to Interference</h3> 

The semantic interference effect in language production is markedly similar to the memory phenomenon of <em>retrieval-induced forgetting</em>. In this paradigm, participants learn category-exemplar pairs (e.g., FRUIT - orange), "practice" retrieving a subset, and then are cued to recall all items. Although this paradigm uses a cued word-stem procedure instead of picture naming, they find the same basic effect: recalling an item from memory makes it more difficult to recall semantically related items later on (Anderson et al., 1994). Researchers have posited that semantic interference in language production is essentially a form of retrieval-induced forgetting (Oppenheim et al., 2010; Navarrete et al., 2021). To investigate this idea, we designed an experiment to assess if the temporal dynamics of RIF mirror the incremental effects observed in language production, as well as if cued word retrieval affects general lexical accessibility. We measured latencies across ordinal positions of related items in all phases and implemented a continuous picture naming task in the final phase. We found that interference accrued linearly with the number of retrieved related items, directly mimicking the findings in the language production literature. In addition, we found that generating words in response to word-stem cues during the practice phase made it more difficult to name pictures related to those words ("Activated" condition) later on. Together, these findings suggest that language and memory literatures may be studying different aspects of the same underlying mechanism.

    <h2 style="color: #6cab6c;">Computational Approaches to Lexical Search</h2>
    <p>
      In my current postdoctoral position, I am working with my supervisor *[Dr. Abhilasha Kumar](https://abhilashak.weebly.com/)* and our collaborator *[Dr. Mike Jones](https://www.jonesmn.com/)* to investigate computational models of semantic search. Specifically, we are modeling the semantic fluency task to better understand the structure of semantic memory, the types of information people use to search for related words, as well as the processes in which this information is utilized. In the semantic fluency task, participants are presented with a category (e.g., Animals) and asked to generate as many exemplars as possible. Researchers have found that people tend to retrieve words in related "clusters," and the way they "switch" to new areas of search mirrors the way animals <em>optimally forage</em> for resources in their environment (Hills et al., 2012). Even though the semantic fluency task doesn't ask participants to consider how words sound, Kumar et al. (2022) found that people tend to use phonological similarity to guide their search within and across clusters.
