Even though speaking is learned readily at a relatively early stage of development, it is far from a simple process. Rather, in order to speak even a single word, we must map the semantic concept we want to convey to a specific word, which must then be broken down into the minute phonological units found within our specific language system. My research investigates how people navigate this intricate process.

    <p>
      You may recall instances in which your parent mistakenly referred to you by your sibling’s name, or perhaps worse, by the cat’s name. While it may be tempting to attribute this error to a lack of parental affection, it is in reality a reflection of the interconnectivity among related concepts and words. It is thought that the activation of one concept leads to the concurrent activation of semantically related concepts, as well as the respective words associated with those concepts (e.g., Dell et al., 1997; Levelt et al., 1999). This results in the activation of multiple words when only one can be spoken at any given time. Lexical selection, or the mapping of a concept to a single word, is a critical stage in production that is well poised to illuminate the interface between our memory and language systems. The phenomenon I have used to study this interface is termed the <em>semantic interference effect</em>, the phenomenon in which it is more difficult to produce a word amidst semantically related words.

### How do we study it?
Semantic interference is often studied through timed picture naming tasks that require generation of names from memory. Pictures are assumed to activate conceptual knowledge and corresponding sectors of the lexicon from which the most fitting name is selected. Picture naming is thus a proxy for the general process of conceptually-driven word retrieval. Researchers have used the picture-interference task, the cyclic (blocked) picture naming task, and the continuous picture naming task to study this phenomenon. The general finding is that it takes longer to name a picture if you have recently named a related picture, and production difficulty increases linearly with the number of named associates.
