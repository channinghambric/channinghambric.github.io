I am a cognitive scientist who studies the dynamic interface between semantic memory and language. Broadly speaking, I am interested in exploring how densely connected and multifaceted semantic representations are selected and evoked through everyday language use. My recent work has explored the adaptive learning mechanisms thought to underlie interference during production as well as computational approaches to semantic search.
